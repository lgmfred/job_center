Job center:- A simple job management service 
============================================
![Build Status](https://github.com/lgmfred/job_center/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)

A terrible solution to the **Chapter 22** exercise in Joe's [Programming Erlang (2nd edition)](https://pragprog.com/titles/jaerlang2/programming-erlang-2nd-edition/). _Read the book if you haven't already. It's good!_
